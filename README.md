## Overview

The design space for edge AI hardware supporting large language model (LLM) inference and continual learning is underexplored. We present 3D-CIMlet, a thermal-aware modeling and co-design framework for 2.5D/3D edge-LLM engines exploiting heterogeneous computing-in-memory (CIM) chiplets, adaptable for both inference and continual learning. Central to our heterogeneous design is exploiting a “full retention spectrum” with RRAM-CIM and eDRAM-CIM in mixed technology nodes. Our technology-to-architecture modeling framework with thermal analysis comprehensively explores this heterogeneous chiplet design space, revealing unique opportunities and design considerations for scalable, energy-efficient inference and continual learning of edge LLMs. The framework will be open-sourced and made publicly available.
